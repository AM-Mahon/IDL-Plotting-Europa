# IDL Hybrid simulator plotting

## Usage

This program requires IDL to run, unfortunately GDL does not seem to work.  
First update the appropriate variables in Create_movie.pro, then compile it, then the rest of the files. Run Create_movie.pro. Output (.gif files) will be created in your home directory.
